# MacroVis

Java tool that works in tandem with Rust in this commit: https://github.com/DanielJCampbell/rust/tree/Stepwise
Using the macro expansion JSON data generated by Rust, visualises that data, allowing users to view the expanded macro traces of any simple crates. Also comes with basic file loading/saving/editing functionality, for ease of use.
