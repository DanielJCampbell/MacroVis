# MacroVis

Java tool that works in tandem with Rust in this commit: https://github.com/DanielJCampbell/rust/tree/Stepwise

Using the macro expansion JSON data generated by Rust, visualises that data, allowing users to view the expanded macro traces of any simple (single-file) crates. Also comes with basic file loading/saving/editing functionality, for ease of use.

This tool has been constructed by Daniel Campbell to meet the requirements of the COMP 489 Honours paper at Victoria University of Wellington.
